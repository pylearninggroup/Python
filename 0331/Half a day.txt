  I walked alongside my father, clutching his right hand. All my clothes were new: the black shoes, the green school uniform, and the red cap. They did not make me happy,
however, as this was the day I was to be thrown into school for the first time.
  My mother stood at the window watching our progress, and I turned towards her from time to time, hoping she would help. We walked along a street lined with gardens and
fields planted with crops, pears, and date palms.
  "Why school?" I asked my father. "What have I done?"
  "I'm not punishing you," he said, laughing. "School's not a punishment. It's a place that makes useful men out of boys. Don't you want to be useful like your brothers?"
